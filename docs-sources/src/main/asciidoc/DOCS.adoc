= Cloud Pipelines

Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud are tools that let developers speed up the
time of creating new business features. It is common knowledge, however, that the
feature is only valuable if it is in production. That is why companies
spend a lot of time and resources on building their own deployment pipelines.

This project tries to solve the following problems:

* Creation of a common deployment pipeline.
* Propagation of good testing and deployment practices.
* Reducing the time required to deploy a feature to production.

A common way of running, configuring, and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.
