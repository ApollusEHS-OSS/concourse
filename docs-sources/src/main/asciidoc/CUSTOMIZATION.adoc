=== Overriding Project Setup

If you want to customize the Cloud Pipelines build, you can update the contents
of the `gradle/custom.gradle` build script. That way your customizations will not
interfere with the changes in the main part of the code, thus there should be
no merge conflicts when pulling the changes from Cloud Pipeline repositories.

Currently, the best way to extend the Concourse is to make
a copy of the Concourse pipeline `yaml` files and modify it.
